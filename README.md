# nested_sqflite

Test of a database field pointing to another database, but it's very messy.  
This is just a test of making a table row point to another table, but it is very brute forced, because I'm not good at SQL ou databases in general yet.  

## Advice

I really don't recommend putting this in a real phone, if you are going to use this, go with an emulator, because I think it leaves some junk files as of right now.
