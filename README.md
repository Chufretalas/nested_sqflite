# nested_sqflite

This is just a test of making a table row point to another table, but it is very brute forced, because I'm not good at SQL ou databases in general yet.  
As I learn I'll try to improve this.

## Advice

I really don't recommend putting this in a real phone, if you are going to use this, go with an emulator, because I think it leaves some junk files as of right now.
